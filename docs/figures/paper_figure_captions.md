## Figure 1 — Canonical Risk Taxonomy
Eight super-domains of conversational AI risk, integrating vulnerability, regulatory, economic, informational, security, privacy, reliability, and systemic governance concerns. The taxonomy operationalizes internationally convergent AI risk framing into a conversational guardrail benchmark.

## Figure 2 — Isolation Performance by Control
Top isolated controls by environment. The figure shows that marginal guardrail value is environment-dependent: healthcare scenarios favor urgency-sensitive and escalation-capable controls, while finance scenarios place more weight on compliance and vulnerability-sensitive adaptation.

## Figure 3 — Complementarity Heatmap
Pairwise synergy among guardrail controls. Positive interactions indicate portfolios where controls provide super-additive gains; negative or near-zero regions indicate redundancy. This supports the claim that compliant conversational systems are better represented as portfolios than as single safety layers.

## Figure 4 — EvoGuard Search Progress
Best objective achieved per generation across environments. The figure illustrates how different environments select different compliance architectures under the same search process.

## Figure 5 — Pareto Frontier of Evolved Stacks
Non-dominated guardrail architectures plotted over safety and compliance, with utility encoded by point size. This demonstrates that no single architecture dominates across all objectives and motivates explicit tradeoff-aware optimization.

## Figure 6 — Best Evolved Stack by Environment
Top evolved architecture for each environment. The figure shows that healthcare, finance, adversarial, and edge-constrained deployments converge to distinct portfolios of controls.

## Figure 7 — Model Tradeoff: Objective vs Risk-Domain Coverage
Performance of model-conditioned winning stacks, showing tradeoffs between overall objective and risk-domain coverage. This highlights the importance of considering deployment and quantization feasibility alongside raw model capability.

## Figure 8 — Control Motifs in Winning Stacks
Frequency with which each guardrail primitive appears in the best evolved stacks. This summarizes which controls act as recurring “compliance motifs” across regulated conversational environments.

## Figure 9 — Stack Quality by Environment
Stack-order score of the best evolved architecture in each regulated environment. Higher values indicate more functionally coherent layering, rewarding architectures that detect, interpret, constrain, verify, escalate, and audit in an order consistent with conversational risk management.

## Figure 10 — Layer Diversity in Winning Stacks
Number and spread of distinct layers used by the best evolved architecture in each environment. This figure illustrates that higher-risk environments tend to require more functionally diverse compliance stacks.
